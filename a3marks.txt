CS349 ASSIGNMENT 3 MARKING SCHEME
MARKED BY: Jeff Avery (j2avery)

GUIDELINES
The assignment needs to compile and run in order for the TA to mark it. If it 
doesn't compile, but the TA is able to get it working, you will only lose marks 
for the "Compiles and runs" section. If they cannot get it to compile, you 
receive zero for the assignment.

Remark requests will be considered for 2 weeks following the release of the 
marks for this assignment. To request a remark, contact the TA that marked 
your assignment (identified above) during office hours or through email.

TOTAL: 
105/100 (With up to 5 bonus pts.)
